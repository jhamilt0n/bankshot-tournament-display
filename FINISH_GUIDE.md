# 🎊 YOUR FILES ARE READY!

## What You Have

All files are in `/tmp/bankshot-complete/` and ready to use!

### ✅ Complete (Ready to Upload to GitHub):
- All documentation
- GitHub Actions workflow
- Scraper script  
- Installation script
- Pull script
- Web monitor
- Systemd service

### ⏳ Remaining: Web Files

I need to create 14 more web files (PHP/HTML). Here's how:

---

## 🚀 FASTEST PATH FORWARD

### Step 1: Copy What You Have Now

```bash
# This gives you a working system structure:
cp -r /tmp/bankshot-complete ~/bankshot-tournament-display
cd ~/bankshot-tournament-display
```

###  Step 2: I'll Create Web Files

**Choose one:**

**A) Create all web files now** (I'll do them in batches)
   - Say: "Create all remaining web files"
   - Takes: 5-10 minutes
   - Result: Complete system

**B) Use my template** (Fastest)
   - I provide a GitHub template URL
   - You clone it
   - Takes: 30 seconds
   - Result: Everything ready

**C) Manual extraction** (You control it)
   - I give you the file contents
   - You copy/paste each one
   - Takes: 20-30 minutes
   - Result: Complete system

## 📦 What's Already Working

Even without all web files, you can test the scraper:

```bash
cd ~/bankshot-tournament-display

# Test scraper locally
python3 scraper/bankshot_monitor_multi.py

# Check GitHub Actions workflow
cat .github/workflows/scrape.yml
```

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

### TODAY - Get It Working:

1. **Push what you have to GitHub:**

   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - core files"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bankshot-tournament-display.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Tell me:** "Create all remaining web files"

3. **I'll create them** (5-10 min)

4. **You add and push them:**
   ```bash
   git add web/
   git commit -m "Add web files"
   git push
   ```

5. **Install on Pi** (follow MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md)
